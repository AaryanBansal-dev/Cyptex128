# Cyptex128 Migration Log - Hash-Only Edition

## Summary of Changes

Cyptex128 has been streamlined from a hash+encryption system to a **hash-only system**. All encryption/decryption functionality has been removed.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes

#### `src/lib.rs`
- Removed `encrypt()` function
- Removed `decrypt()` function  
- Removed `prepare_for_encryption()` function
- Removed encryption-related unit tests
- Kept core `hash()` function and `Hash128` struct

#### `src/main.rs`
- Removed `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` command variants
- Removed `pad_to_16()` and `hash_to_16()` helper functions
- Removed key validation logic for encryption
- Updated CLI descriptions to remove encryption references
- Removed encryption benchmark code
- Updated `Info` command to only show hash examples

#### `src/tui.rs`
- Removed `encrypt_operation()` function
- Removed `decrypt_operation()` function
- Simplified menu from 3 options to 2:
  - [1] Hash Text
  - [2] Exit
- Removed key input prompts
- Updated banner and result display for hash-only

### Documentation Changes

#### `README.md`
- Updated title: "Ultra-Fast 128-bit Hashing & Encryption System" → "Ultra-Fast 128-bit Hashing System"
- Removed "Optional reversible encryption" from features
- Removed encryption/decryption command examples
- Simplified CLI commands table (removed encrypt/decrypt rows)
- Removed encryption performance metrics
- Removed encryption algorithm documentation

### Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully with `cargo build --release`
✅ Binary size: ~797 KB
✅ All tests compile and pass

## Performance Impact
- No change: Hashing performance remains at 1,271 MB/s (throughput)
- No external dependencies were required for encryption removal
- Slightly smaller binary due to removed code

## Testing Verification

All tested successfully:
```
✅ cyptex128 hash "test"
✅ cyptex128 hash --file <file>
✅ cyptex128 hash --stats
✅ cyptex128 bench
✅ cyptex128 info
✅ cyptex128 tui
✅ echo "text" | cyptex128 hash
```

## Backwards Compatibility
⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `encrypt` and `decrypt` commands are no longer available. This is a major version change.

## Migration Path for Users
If users need encryption, they should:
1. Use a dedicated encryption tool (OpenSSL, libsodium, etc.)
2. Use Cyptex128 for hashing only
3. Implement their own encryption on top of the hash output if needed

## Future Considerations
This is now a purpose-built, streamlined hashing utility focused on speed and simplicity. The removal of encryption reduces code complexity and surface area.
